Miner's Watchbot for "EWBF's cryptocurrency for CUDA miner" is created to help the miners 
for exercising control over their rigs. The bot interacts with the API of 
"EWBF's cryptocurrency for CUDA miner" version 0.3.4 b. It allows in real time to obtain 
the necessary information about the condition of the rig and have feedback in critical 
situations directly in the telegram chat. This bot was built using [pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI/).
